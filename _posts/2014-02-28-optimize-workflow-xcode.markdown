Xcode is the IDE you'll be always using when developing MacOS apps or iOS apps. It's sometimes frustrating, and sometimes brillant, here are some hints to optimize your workflow and keep your brain fresh when using it.

I can already hear people saying that's we do not have to use Xcode all the time. It's true. For all the text based files, you can use whatever your want. SublimeText or Vim, or AppCode from JetBrains. But when it comes to editing nibs and storyboard, the choice is all made, you'll have to use Xcode (as far as I know).

After years working with Xcode, you learn to to overpass the first feeling you had with it. Of course, the time of Xcode 3 is way behind us, and Xcode 4 made the things a lot better, believe me.

###My eyes are bleeding!

Lets's begin with the visual part. This is not specific to Xcode or any IDE, but you must use the colorscheme that better fits your eyes. As a personnal hint, prefer darker themes to avoid tears after just two hours behind a bright blank screen. For instance, I use [zenburn][zenburn] most of the time.

All colors are dimmed, and the background is not a full black color, but rather a dimmed pastel black. You can find the colorscheme [here][xcode-zenburn], with the instructions to change you colorscheme in Xcode.
